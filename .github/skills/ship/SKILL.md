# Ship Skill

This skill has two modes:

| Mode | Triggers | Best for |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Standard** (default) | `ship`, `ship this`, `ship it`, `ship a feature` | Most features, fixes, refactors |
| **Critical** | `ship-critical`, `[ship-critical]`, `ship thoroughly`, `ship with full review` | Security-sensitive, public API changes, complex core logic |

> **⚠️ This skill MUST be invoked whenever the user says "ship". Do NOT implement changes directly — always go through this workflow.**

---

## Mode Comparison

| Aspect | `ship` (standard) | `ship-critical` |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Worktree isolation | ✅ | ✅ |
| Written plan | ✅ | ✅ |
| clips integration | ✅ | ✅ |
| vitest skill | ✅ | ✅ |
| Code review | ✅ Constructive (task agent) | ✅ Adversarial (adversarial-review skill) |
| No-PR option | ✅ Supported | ❌ Not supported |

The **only difference** between modes is the review approach:
- **Standard mode**: Constructive review — "help me improve this code"
- **Critical mode**: Adversarial review — "try to break this code" (invokes **adversarial-review** skill)

---

## Parameters

| Parameter | Applies to | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **no-pr** | `ship` (standard only) | Skip opening a Pull Request. The branch is still pushed to the remote. Use for draft work or when you'll open the PR manually later. |

**How to activate no-PR mode (standard only):**
- Verbal: *"ship this but don't create a PR"*, *"ship without PR"*
- Short-form: *"ship-no-pr"*, *"[ship-no-pr]"*
- Combined: *"ship a feature to add X — no PR"*

> **Note:** `ship-critical` always opens a PR. The no-PR option is not available for critical mode because thorough review warrants a PR for visibility.

---

## About the Code Review Step

Both modes use a **task agent** (via the `task` tool) to review the implementation. This is NOT the same as Copilot CLI's "rubber duck" mode — it's a separate agent launched in a subprocess to review the diff.

| Review Type | Used in | Framing |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Constructive | `ship` (standard) | "Review this code and suggest improvements" |
| Adversarial | `ship-critical` | Invokes **adversarial-review** skill — "Try to break this code" |

The adversarial framing is more thorough but also more expensive (tokens + time). Use it for changes where finding bugs before merge is critical.

# Standard Mode (`ship`)

> Triggered by: `ship`, `ship this`, `ship it`, `ship a feature`, `ship a change`

Full workflow for most changes. Includes clips, vitest, and constructive code review.

## Steps

### Step 1: Create a worktree

Invoke the **worktree** skill to create a git worktree for the feature branch.

- Derive a kebab-case branch name from the user's feature description (e.g., "add dark mode toggle" → `add-dark-mode-toggle`).
- If the user provided an explicit branch name, use that instead.
- Use `ask_user` to confirm the branch name before creating the worktree.

After the worktree is created, all subsequent work happens inside `.worktrees/<branch-name>`.

### Step 2: Plan the feature

Generate an implementation plan for the requested feature:

1. Explore the codebase to understand the relevant areas.
2. Write a structured plan to `.github/plans/<branch-name>.md` (inside the worktree).
3. The plan must include:
   - **Problem statement** — what the feature does and why
   - **Approach** — high-level strategy
   - **Files to change** — list of files to create, modify, or delete
   - **Steps** — ordered implementation steps
   - **Edge cases & risks** — anything that could go wrong
4. Present a summary of the plan to the user.
5. Use `ask_user` to confirm:
   > Does this plan look good? Should I proceed with implementation?

Do NOT proceed until the user confirms.

### Step 3: Create clips goal/tasks

**If the `clips` skill is available** (check for `.clips/` directory or `clips` CLI), create tracking issues before implementation begins:

1. Run `clips view` to check for a relevant existing goal.
2. If a matching goal exists, create tasks under it for the planned work.
3. If no matching goal exists, create a new goal with tasks derived from the plan.
4. **Save the goal ID and issue number** — you will need these for the PR body.

If clips is not available, skip this step silently.

### Step 4: Implement and commit

Execute the plan:

1. Implement the changes following the plan.
2. Run validation: `npm run lint && npm run build && npm run test`
3. Fix any issues that arise.
4. Stage and commit with a descriptive message:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "<type>: <description>

<body if needed>

Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>"
```

Use conventional commit types (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, etc.).

### Step 5: Write tests

**Invoke the `vitest` skill** to write tests for the implementation:

1. Identify all new or changed logic that is testable (utilities, data transformations, hooks, state management, etc.).
2. Write tests using Vitest, following existing test patterns in the codebase.
3. Run `npm run test` to verify all tests pass (new and existing).
4. Fix any failures.
5. Stage and commit tests separately:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "test: add tests for <feature>

Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>"
```

**Skip this step only if** the change is purely documentation, configuration, or markup with no testable logic.

### Step 6: Constructive code review

Launch a **task agent** (using the `task` tool with `agent_type: "general-purpose"`) to review the implementation. Include the plan from Step 2 and the diff of all changes.

The prompt should use **constructive framing**:

> You are a helpful code reviewer. Review this implementation and suggest improvements. Look for:
>
> 1. **Code quality** — readability, maintainability, DRY violations
> 2. **Potential bugs** — edge cases, error handling, type safety
> 3. **Performance** — unnecessary re-renders, inefficient algorithms
> 4. **Best practices** — following codebase conventions, proper abstractions
>
> Provide specific, actionable suggestions. Prioritize by impact.

#### Process feedback

1. Apply suggestions that improve code quality without over-engineering.
2. Skip suggestions that are purely stylistic or don't provide clear value.
3. If any changes were made, run lint/build/test again and commit:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: address review feedback

<summary of what was improved>

Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>"
```

### Step 7: Push to remote

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

If the push fails due to permissions or remote issues, inform the user and suggest manual steps.

### Step 8: Open a PR

> **⏭️ Skip this step if no-PR mode is active.** After pushing, inform the user that the branch is available at `origin/<branch-name>` and they can open a PR manually when ready.

Use the GitHub CLI to create a pull request:

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "<PR title>" \
  --body "<PR body>" \
  --base main \
  --head <branch-name>
```

The PR body must include:
- **Summary** — what this PR does (from the plan)
- **Changes** — bullet list of files changed and why
- **Testing** — what was validated (lint, build, test results)
- **Fixes** — if clips issues were created in Step 3, include `Fixes #<issue_number>` for each goal/task so they auto-close when the PR merges

Use `ask_user` to confirm the PR title and description before creating.

### Step 9: Close clips tasks

After the PR is opened (or after push if no-PR mode), mark clips tasks as closed:

1. Run `clips view` to find the goal/tasks created in Step 3.
2. Mark them as closed (`clips task status ... closed` / `clips goal status ... closed`).

If clips was skipped in Step 3, skip this step too.

### Step 10: Start dev server

Run the dev server in the worktree so the user can immediately preview changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

# Critical Mode (`ship-critical`)

> Triggered by: `ship-critical`, `[ship-critical]`, `ship thoroughly`, `ship with full review`, `ship careful`

Same workflow as standard mode, but with **adversarial code review** instead of constructive review.

## Steps

Steps 1-5 are identical to standard mode:
1. Create a worktree
2. Plan the feature
3. Create clips goal/tasks
4. Implement and commit
5. Write tests

### Step 6: Adversarial code review

Invoke the **adversarial-review** skill to run a cross-model adversarial review.

The adversarial-review skill will:
1. Select a model from a different family than the current session
2. Launch a task agent with adversarial framing
3. Report CRITICAL and HIGH severity findings
4. Apply fixes and commit changes

See the **adversarial-review** skill documentation for full details.

#### Process findings

After the adversarial-review skill completes:

1. All CRITICAL fixes should already be applied.
2. HIGH fixes should be applied unless intentionally deferred (with justification).
3. If any changes were made, they should already be committed by the skill.
4. Review the summary of findings for the PR body.

Steps 7-10 are identical to standard mode:
7. Push to remote
8. Open a PR (required — no-PR not supported)
9. Close clips tasks
10. Start dev server

The PR body in critical mode must also include:
- **Review notes** — summary of adversarial review findings and how they were addressed

---

## Rules (Both Modes)

- **Always create a worktree first** — invoke the worktree skill as Step 1, before any exploration or implementation. Never commit to `main`. The worktree IS the branch.
- **Always run lint/build/test** before committing — at minimum `npm run lint && npm run build && npm run test`.
- **Always use `ask_user`** for confirmations — branch name, plan approval, PR details.
- **Conventional commits** — use `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:` prefixes.
- **Co-authored-by trailer** — every commit must include the Copilot co-author trailer.
- **If any step fails**, stop and inform the user with the error and suggested next steps. Do not silently continue.
- **Context inference** — if the user's prompt already provides the branch name, feature description, or other details, skip the corresponding `ask_user` question and use the provided value directly.

### Critical-mode specific rules

- **Always invoke adversarial-review skill** — this is the quality gate. The adversarial review pass is mandatory.
- **Always open a PR** — critical mode does not support no-PR. If `gh pr create` fails, inform the user immediately.
