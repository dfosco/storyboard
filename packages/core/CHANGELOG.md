# @dfosco/storyboard-core

## 3.1.2

### Patch Changes

-   Add `@lucide/svelte` and `marked` to package dependencies (were only declared in monorepo root, causing "Could not resolve" errors in consumers).
-   Inline the `smooth-corners` paint worklet to avoid Vite-specific `?url` import that breaks when source is consumed from `node_modules`. Removes `smooth-corners` as a dependency.

## 3.1.1

### Patch Changes

-   Fixes package resolution errors when consuming `@dfosco/storyboard-core` and `@dfosco/tiny-canvas` from npm.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

-   3.1.0 -- Canvas, external prototypes, and polish. This release adds the full canvas system — an infinite, zoomable workspace for arranging widgets and embedding prototypes — along with external prototype support for linking to apps hosted elsewhere. Includes a wave of bug fixes across comments, inspector, and accessibility.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Introduces Core UI with commands and menus for storyboard
-   a00140e: # Core UI Release — v3.0.0

    ## ✨ New Features

    ### Config-Driven Menu System

    -   **Command menu with structured action types** — actions support `toggle`, `link`, `separator`, `header`, and `footer` types with per-action mode visibility.
    -   **Config-driven menus** — all CoreUIBar menu buttons are declared in `core-ui.config.json` under the `menus` key, supporting sidepanel buttons and custom Svelte components.
    -   **Create Menu** — replaces the old Workshop menu with config-driven items and icon/character support.
    -   **Flow Switcher button** — new CoreUIBar button that lists all flows for the current prototype and allows switching between them.
    -   **Devtools submenu** — inspector deep-links, mode locking, and `ui.hide` config support.
    -   **Link action type** — URL-based menu items that navigate via `window.location.href`.

    ### Panel Component

    -   **New `Panel` UI component** — anchored side panel replacing modal dialogs, with proper portal handling so nested `DropdownMenu` components work correctly.
    -   **SidePanel system** — `sidePanelStore` manages panel state; panels for docs and inspector are included.
    -   **Inspector Panel** — component inspector with fiber walker and mouse-mode selection.
    -   **Doc Panel** — embedded documentation viewer via `docs-handler.js`.

    ### Icon System

    -   **Multi-source icon system** — supports Primer Octicons, Iconoir, and custom SVG icons through a unified `Icon` component.
    -   **Icon `meta` config** — menu config supports `meta` object for `strokeWeight`, `scale`, `rotate` props.
    -   **Iconoir support** — fill-based and stroke-based Iconoir icons registered as sources.

    ### Storyboard React

    -   **`useFlows()` hook** — lists all flows for the current prototype with `switchFlow()` navigation. Exported from `@dfosco/storyboard-react`.
    -   **`getFlowsForPrototype()` and `getFlowMeta()`** — new core loader utilities for flow discovery.

    ### Other

    -   **Ioskeley Mono font** — custom monospace font for core UI menus and mode selector.
    -   **Comment draft persistence** — composer saves drafts, repositions correctly, and autofocuses.
    -   **Mode hue colors** — modes now support a `hue` property for theming.
    -   **`ui.hide` config** — hide CoreUIBar and mode switcher via `storyboard.config.json`.
    -   **Toggle mode switcher with `Cmd+.`** alongside CoreUIBar.
    -   **`excludeRoutes` base path stripping** — route exclusion patterns are now portable across different base paths.

    ## 🐛 Bug Fixes

    -   Template dropdown placeholder is no longer a selectable option
    -   DropdownMenu z-index raised above Panel (`z-50` → `z-[10000]`)
    -   Panel no longer dismisses when clicking portaled children
    -   Focus trap disabled on Panel so nested portaled menus work
    -   Toggle actions execute correctly while keeping menu open
    -   Workshop features detected from registry, not DOM attribute
    -   Action menu visibility re-evaluated on SPA navigation
    -   `menuWidth` config properly applied to ActionMenuButton dropdown
    -   Button `wrapperVariants` and wrapper-aware sizing restored
    -   Viewfinder template errors repaired

    ## 📝 Documentation

    -   Renamed `scene` → `flow` across README and AGENTS.md
    -   Added storyboard-core skill for CoreUIBar menu buttons
    -   Documented new features (flow switcher, config-driven menus, panel system)
